  - Create comprehensive error inventory with priorities
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.3, 3.1_

- [ ] 2. Fix import path resolution errors
  - [ ] 2.1 Scan all source files for import statements
    - Use automated tools to identify all import/export statements
    - Map current import paths to actual file locations
    - Identify broken or incorrect import paths
    - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.3_

  - [x] 2.2 Correct Supabase client import paths
    - Fix the primary import path error in Supabase client integration
    - Update any related imports that depend on the Supabase client
    - Validate import paths resolve to correct modules
    - _Requirements: 1.2, 2.1, 2.4_

  - [ ] 2.3 Update all incorrect relative and absolute imports
    - Correct any remaining import path errors found in the scan
    - Ensure consistent use of path aliases (@/ prefix where appropriate)
    - Update imports affected by any file restructuring
    - _Requirements: 2.2, 2.3, 2.4_

- [ ] 3. Resolve TypeScript compilation issues
  - [ ] 3.1 Fix TypeScript type errors
    - Run TypeScript compiler to identify type issues
    - Resolve missing type declarations and interfaces
    - Fix type compatibility issues between modules
    - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2_

  - [ ] 3.2 Validate TypeScript configuration
    - Review tsconfig.json for correct path mappings
    - Ensure all source files are included in compilation
    - Verify TypeScript compiler options are optimal
    - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2_

- [ ] 4. Verify and resolve dependencies
  - [ ] 4.1 Check for missing dependencies
    - Scan package.json against actual imports in code
    - Identify any missing packages that need installation
    - Verify all external dependencies are properly declared
    - _Requirements: 3.2, 3.3_

  - [ ] 4.2 Resolve dependency version conflicts
    - Check for version incompatibilities between packages
    - Update or pin dependency versions as needed
    - Ensure peer dependencies are satisfied
    - _Requirements: 3.2, 3.3_

- [ ] 5. Validate build configuration
  - [ ] 5.1 Review Vite build configuration
    - Examine vite.config.ts for correct settings
    - Verify path aliases and module resolution configuration
    - Ensure build optimization settings are appropriate
    - _Requirements: 1.1, 3.4_

  - [x] 5.2 Test build process end-to-end
    - Run complete production build process
    - Verify all output files are generated correctly
    - Check bundle sizes and optimization results
    - _Requirements: 1.4, 1.5, 3.4, 3.5_

- [ ] 6. Implement build validation and error reporting
  - [ ] 6.1 Create build error detection system
    - Implement automated error categorization
    - Generate clear error reports with actionable suggestions
    - Create build status monitoring and reporting
    - _Requirements: 1.3, 2.4, 3.3_

  - [ ]* 6.2 Add build verification tests
    - Create automated tests for build process validation
    - Implement tests for import resolution verification
    - Add tests for TypeScript compilation validation
    - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.3, 3.1_

- [ ] 7. Final validation and cleanup
  - [x] 7.1 Run comprehensive build verification
    - Execute clean production build from scratch
    - Verify all previous errors are resolved
    - Test application functionality after build
    - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.4, 1.5_

  - [ ] 7.2 Document build process and requirements
    - Create documentation for successful build process
    - Document any configuration changes made
    - Provide troubleshooting guide for future build issues
    - _Requirements: 1.3, 3.3_

  - [ ]* 7.3 Optimize build performance
    - Analyze build time and bundle size metrics
    - Implement optimizations for faster builds
    - Configure code splitting and lazy loading optimizations
    - _Requirements: 3.4, 3.5_
