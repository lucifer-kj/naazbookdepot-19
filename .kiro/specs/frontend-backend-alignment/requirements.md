# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the critical need to review, debug, and refactor the entire frontend codebase to ensure full alignment with backend logic and APIs. The goal is to make the application production-ready by synchronizing data flows, fixing routing issues, cleaning up code, and ensuring UI/UX stability for tomorrow's release.

## Glossary

- **Frontend_System**: The React TypeScript application that provides the user interface
- **Backend_APIs**: The Supabase-based backend services and API endpoints
- **Data_Flow**: The movement of data between frontend components and backend services
- **State_Management**: The frontend state management system handling application data
- **Route_System**: The frontend routing configuration and navigation logic
- **Component_Architecture**: The React component structure and hierarchy
- **API_Integration**: The connection layer between frontend and backend services
- **Build_System**: The Vite-based build and deployment system
- **Console_Errors**: JavaScript runtime errors and warnings displayed in browser console

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all frontend data flows to correctly correspond to backend endpoints and responses, so that the application functions reliably without data mismatches.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN frontend components make API calls, THE API_Integration SHALL use correct endpoint URLs and request formats
2. WHEN backend responses are received, THE Frontend_System SHALL handle response data structures without undefined variables
3. WHEN data is displayed in components, THE Frontend_System SHALL map backend response fields to correct component props
4. IF API responses change structure, THEN THE Frontend_System SHALL handle the changes gracefully with proper error handling
5. THE State_Management SHALL synchronize with backend data without causing binding errors

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want all navigation and routing to work seamlessly, so that I can access all intended pages without broken links or routing errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to any route, THE Route_System SHALL render the correct page component
2. WHEN routes are accessed, THE Route_System SHALL match frontend routes with intended backend route behaviors
3. THE Route_System SHALL remove all broken, duplicate, or deprecated routes from the configuration
4. WHEN navigation occurs, THE Route_System SHALL provide logical user flow without dead ends
5. WHERE protected routes exist, THE Route_System SHALL properly handle authentication checks

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clean and stable codebase, so that the application can be maintained efficiently and deployed without issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Frontend_System SHALL remove all unused, duplicate, or obsolete files from the codebase
2. WHEN the application runs, THE Frontend_System SHALL produce zero console errors and warnings
3. THE Component_Architecture SHALL follow standardized imports, naming conventions, and folder structure
4. WHEN code is built, THE Build_System SHALL complete successfully without compilation errors
5. THE Frontend_System SHALL maintain consistent code patterns and best practices throughout

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want all pages to render correctly with proper UI elements, so that I can interact with the application without visual or functional issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any page loads, THE Frontend_System SHALL render all UI elements without broken components
2. WHEN components receive props, THE Frontend_System SHALL handle all prop types correctly without missing logic
3. THE Frontend_System SHALL display no placeholder content or incomplete layouts in production
4. WHEN responsive design is applied, THE Frontend_System SHALL maintain layout consistency across devices
5. WHERE user interactions occur, THE Frontend_System SHALL provide appropriate feedback and state updates

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a stakeholder, I want critical application paths to function end-to-end, so that users can complete essential tasks without technical failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users authenticate, THE Frontend_System SHALL handle login/logout flows without errors
2. WHEN users access the dashboard, THE Frontend_System SHALL load and display data correctly
3. WHEN users interact with API-driven pages, THE Frontend_System SHALL process requests and responses properly
4. WHEN users submit forms, THE Frontend_System SHALL validate, submit, and handle responses appropriately
5. THE Frontend_System SHALL support all critical user journeys from start to completion

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a deployment engineer, I want the application to build and deploy cleanly, so that production releases can proceed without technical blockers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the build process runs, THE Build_System SHALL complete without any compilation errors
2. WHEN the application starts, THE Frontend_System SHALL initialize without runtime errors
3. THE Build_System SHALL generate optimized production assets suitable for deployment
4. WHEN deployed, THE Frontend_System SHALL function correctly in the production environment
5. THE Frontend_System SHALL pass all critical path validations before release approval
