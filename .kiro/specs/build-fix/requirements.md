# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical build failures in the naazbookdepot project that prevent successful production builds. The primary issue is an incorrect import path in the Supabase client integration that causes module resolution failures during the Vite build process.

## Glossary

- **Build System**: The Vite-based build system that compiles TypeScript and bundles the application for production
- **Module Resolution**: The process by which the build system locates and imports dependencies between files
- **Supabase Client**: The database client integration that connects the application to Supabase services
- **Import Path**: The relative or absolute path used in import statements to reference other modules

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the project to build successfully without module resolution errors, so that I can deploy the application to production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the build command is executed, THE Build System SHALL resolve all import paths without errors
2. WHEN the Supabase Client is imported, THE Build System SHALL locate the correct module path
3. IF an import path is incorrect, THEN THE Build System SHALL provide clear error messages indicating the resolution failure
4. THE Build System SHALL complete the production build process without throwing module resolution errors
5. THE Build System SHALL generate all necessary output files in the dist directory upon successful build

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all TypeScript files to have correct import paths, so that the module system works consistently across the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Supabase Client SHALL import from the correct relative path to the main supabase module
2. WHEN files are moved or restructured, THE Import Path SHALL be updated to maintain correct references
3. THE Build System SHALL validate all import statements during the compilation process
4. IF any import path is invalid, THEN THE Build System SHALL fail with descriptive error messages
5. THE Build System SHALL successfully resolve all internal module dependencies

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify and fix any additional build issues beyond import path errors, so that the entire build process is robust and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Build System SHALL complete type checking without TypeScript compilation errors
2. THE Build System SHALL resolve all external dependencies from node_modules
3. IF there are missing dependencies, THEN THE Build System SHALL report specific package names that need to be installed
4. THE Build System SHALL generate optimized production bundles with proper code splitting
5. THE Build System SHALL complete the entire build process within reasonable time limits
